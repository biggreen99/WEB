JavaScript
</h2>

<p>
JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/[6]), often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based, multi-paradigm, and interpreted programming language.
<br>
Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of World Wide Web content production.
<br>
It is used to make webpages interactive and provide online programs, including video games.
<br>
The majority of websites employ it, and all modern web browsers support it without the need for plug-ins by means of a built-in JavaScript engine.
<br>
Each of the many JavaScript engines represent a different implementation of JavaScript, all based on the ECMAScript specification, with some engines not supporting the spec fully, and with many engines supporting additional features beyond ECMA.
